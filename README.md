# WifiConfigViaBluetooth-Android
The project contains the android client for this project: https://github.com/gtntdev/-WifiConfigViaBluetooth-Docker

It is based on [this project](https://github.com/brendan-myers/rpi3-wifi-conf-android).

Just clone the repo, install the docker server and use the app to configure your Wifi.

Many thanks to [Brendan Myers](https://github.com/brendan-myers) for your contributions!

Note: the projects aren't compatible as I changed not only the GUI but added some basic JSON network interface!
